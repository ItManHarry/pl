Problem
    You want to iterate over items in an iterable, but the first few items arenâ€™t of interest and
you just want to discard them.
Solution
    The itertools module has a few functions that can be used to address this task. The
first is the itertools.dropwhile() function. To use it, you supply a function and an
iterable. The returned iterator discards the first items in the sequence as long as the
supplied function returns True. Afterward, the entirety of the sequence is produced.
