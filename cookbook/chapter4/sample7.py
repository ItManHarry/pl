Problem
    You want to take a slice of data produced by an iterator, but the normal slicing operator
doesnâ€™t work.
Solution
    The itertools.islice() function is perfectly suited for taking slices of iterators and
generators.
'''
def count(n):
    while True:
        yield n
        n += 1
c = count(0)
'''
    print(c[10: 20])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:/Development/Python/workplaces/pl/cookbook/chapter4/sample7.py", line 14, in <module>
    print(c[10: 20])
TypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable

import itertools
for e in itertools.islice(c, 10, 20):
    print(e)
