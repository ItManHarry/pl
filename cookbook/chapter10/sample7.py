Making a Directory or Zip File Runnable As a Main
Script
Problem
You have a program that has grown beyond a simple script into an application involving
multiple files. Youâ€™d like to have some easy way for users to run the program.
Solution
If your application program has grown into multiple files, you can put it into its own
directory and add a __main__.py file.
