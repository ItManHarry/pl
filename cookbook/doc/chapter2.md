# String and Text
## 17.Handling HTML and XML Entities in Text
- Problem
> You want to replace HTML or XML entities such as &entity; or &#code; with their
corresponding text. Alternatively, you need to produce text, but escape certain characters
(e.g., <, >, or &).
- Solution
> If you are producing text, replacing special characters such as < or > is relatively easy if
you use the html.escape() function.
