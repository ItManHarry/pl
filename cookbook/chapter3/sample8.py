homework problems involving fractions. Or perhaps youâ€™re writing code to make
calculations involving measurements made in your wood shop.
Solution
    The fractions module can be used to perform mathematical calculations involving
fractions.

from fractions import Fraction
a = Fraction(5, 4)
print('Fraction a : ', a)
b = Fraction(7, 16)
print('Fraction b : ', b)
print('a + b : ', a + b)
print('a - b : ', a - b)
print('a * b : ', a * b)
print('a / b : ', a / b)
c = a * b
print('Numerator : ', c.numerator)
print('Denominator : ', c.denominator)
print('Convert to float : ', float(c))
a = 3.75
f = Fraction(*a.as_integer_ratio())
print('Float to fraction : ', f)
