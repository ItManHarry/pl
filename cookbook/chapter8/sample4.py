'''
Saving Memory When Creating a Large Number of
Instances
Problem
    Your program creates a large number (e.g., millions) of instances and uses a large
amount of memory.
Solution
    For classes that primarily serve as simple data structures, you can often greatly reduce
the memory footprint of instances by adding the __slots__ attribute to the class definition.
'''
class Date:
    __slots__ = ['year', 'month', 'day']

    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        self.year = year
        self.month = month
        self.day = day

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'The date is : {0.year}-{0.month}-{0.day}'.format(self)
d = Date(year=2022, month=7, day=7)
print(d)
'''
When you define __slots__, Python uses a much more compact internal representation
for instances. Instead of each instance consisting of a dictionary, instances are built
around a small fixed-sized array, much like a tuple or list. Attribute names listed in the
__slots__ specifier are internally mapped to specific indices within this array. A side
effect of using slots is that it is no longer possible to add new attributes to instancesâ€”
you are restricted to only those attribute names listed in the __slots__ specifier
