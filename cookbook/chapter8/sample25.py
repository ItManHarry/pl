Creating Cached Instances
Problem
When creating instances of a class, you want to return a cached reference to a previous
instance created with the same arguments (if any).
Solution
The problem being addressed in this recipe sometimes arises when you want to ensure
that there is only one instance of a class created for a set of input arguments. Practical
examples include the behavior of libraries, such as the logging module, that only want
to associate a single logger instance with a given name.
'''
import logging
a = logging.getLogger('foo')
b = logging.getLogger('bar')
c = logging.getLogger('foo')
print('a is b ?', a is b)
print('a is c ?', a is c)
'''
To implement this behavior, you should make use of a factory function thatâ€™s separate
from the class itself.
